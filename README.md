# adbmedic
This is my first project where I was trying Mongo + Express + React (with Redux) + Node stack (MERN) in action.
Project is using remote Mongo DB with a public access (any IP).

In order to run it please execute the following steps:
1. execute `npm install` from the project root directory
2. execute `npm install` from the `client` directory
3. execute `npm run dev` from the project root directory.

This project is also deployed to heroku.<br/>
Feel free to test it out there without cloning the repo and installing project dependencies: https://adbmedic.herokuapp.com/patientCards
